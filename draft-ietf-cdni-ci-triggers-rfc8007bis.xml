   This document obsoletes RFC8007. The document describes the part of Content Delivery Network
   Interconnection (CDNI) Control interface that allows a CDN to trigger
   activity in an interconnected CDN that is configured to deliver
   content on its behalf.  The upstream CDN MAY use this mechanism to
   request that the downstream CDN pre-position metadata or content as well as 
   request that it invalidate or purge metadata or content.  The
   upstream CDN MAY monitor the status of activity that it has triggered
   in the downstream CDN.</t>

	<middle>
	<section title="Introduction" anchor="sect-1"><t>
   <xref target="RFC6707"/> introduces the problem scope for Content Delivery Network
   Interconnection (CDNI) and lists the four categories of interfaces
   that may be used to compose a CDNI solution (Control, Metadata,
   Request Routing, and Logging).</t>

	<t>
   <xref target="RFC7336"/> expands on the information provided in <xref target="RFC6707"/> and
   describes each of the interfaces and the relationships between them
   in more detail.</t>

	<t>
   The CDNI Control Interface / Triggers 1st edition <xref target="RFC8007"/>, deprecated by this document, describes the "CI/T" interface -- "CDNI Control interface / Triggers".  It does not consider those parts of the
   Control interface that relate to configuration, bootstrapping, or
   authentication of CDN Interconnect interfaces.  Section 4 of
   <xref target="RFC7337"/> identifies the requirements specific to the CI/T interface;
   requirements applicable to the CI/T interface are CI-1 to CI-6.</t>
   
   <t>This document is a second edition for the CDNI Control Interface / Triggers, which define a new version, "v2", of the interface objects. The new objects replace the trigger interface's main objects, the "ci-trigger-command" object and its matching "ci-trigger-status" object, and improve the interface's flexibility and extensibility. The document also provides a Trigger Extension mechanism that MAY be used to provide further instruction on the trigger execution. Additionally, this second edition includes cascaded CDN error propagation for improved trigger execution monitoring. Note that the trigger interface mechanism itself is not changed by this new edition.

	<section title="Terminology" anchor="sect-1.1"><t>
   This document reuses the terminology defined in <xref target="RFC6707"/> and uses
   "uCDN" and "dCDN" as shorthand for "upstream CDN" and "downstream CDN", respectively.</t>

   <t>Additionally, the following terms are used throughout this document
      and are defined as follows:</t>

   <t><list style="symbols">
      <t>HLS - HTTP Live Streaming</t>
      <t>DASH - Dynamic Adaptive Streaming Over HTTP</t>

      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
      "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
      described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"></xref> 
              <xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and only when, they
      appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Model for CDNI Triggers" anchor="sect-2"><t>
   A CI/T Command, sent from the uCDN to the dCDN, is a request for the
   dCDN to do some work (an "action") relating to data associated with content
   requests originating from the uCDN.</t>

	<t>
   There are two types of CI/T Commands: CI/T Trigger Commands and CI/T
   Cancel Commands.  The CI/T Cancel Command can be used to request
   cancellation of an earlier CI/T Trigger Command. </t>
   <t>A CI/T Trigger Action is of one of the following:</t>

	<t><list style="symbols"><t>preposition - used to instruct the dCDN to fetch metadata from the
      uCDN or content from any origin including the uCDN.</t>

	<t>invalidate - used to instruct the dCDN to revalidate specific
      metadata or content before reusing it.</t>

	<t>purge - used to instruct the dCDN to delete specific metadata or
      content.</t>

	</list>
	</t>

   <t>
   Note that additional CI/T Trigger Actions can be defined and registered in the future. 
   </t>
	<t>
   The CI/T interface is a web service offered by the dCDN.  It allows
   CI/T Commands to be issued and allows triggered activity to be
   tracked.  The CI/T interface builds on top of HTTP/1.1 <xref target="RFC9112"/>.
   References to URL in this document relate to HTTP/HTTPS URIs, as
   defined in Section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC9110"/>.</t>

	<t>
   When the dCDN accepts a CI/T Command, it creates a resource
   describing the status of the triggered activity -- a Trigger Status
   Resource.  The uCDN can poll Trigger Status Resources to monitor
   progress.</t>

   <t>
   The dCDN maintains at least one collection of Trigger Status
   Resources for each uCDN.  Each uCDN only has access to its own
   collections, the locations of which are shared when CDNI is
   established.</t>

	<t>
   To trigger activity in the dCDN, the uCDN POSTs a CI/T Command to the
   collection of Trigger Status Resources.  If the dCDN accepts the CI/T
   Command, it creates a new Trigger Status Resource and returns its
   location to the uCDN.  To monitor progress, the uCDN can GET the
   Trigger Status Resource.  To request cancellation of a CI/T Trigger
   Command, the uCDN can POST to the collection of Trigger Status
   Resources or simply DELETE the Trigger Status Resource.</t>
   
   <t> Note that the CI/T Command objects POSTed by the uCDN, and CI/T Status Resource objects generated and reported by the dCDN, are matched by their version,  
    i.e., sending a <xref target="RFC8007"/> "ci-trigger-command" object as the command generates a 
   "ci-trigger-status" structured resource to be reported, while sending a "ci-trigger-command.trigger.v2" object generates a "ci-trigger-status.v2" object.</t>

	<t>
   In addition to the collection of all Trigger Status Resources for the
   uCDN, the dCDN can maintain filtered views of that collection.  These
   filtered views are defined in <xref target="sect-3"/> and include collections of
   Trigger Status Resources corresponding to active and completed CI/T
   Trigger Commands.  These collections provide a mechanism for polling
   the status of multiple jobs.</t>

	<t>
   Figure 1 is an example showing the basic message flow used by the
   uCDN to trigger activity in the dCDN and for the uCDN to discover the
   status of that activity.  Only successful triggering is shown.
   Examples of the messages are shown in <xref target="sect-6"/>.</t>

   The steps in Figure 1 are as follows:</t>

	<t><list style="numbers"><t>The uCDN triggers action in the dCDN by POSTing a CI/T Command to
       a collection of Trigger Status Resources --
       "https://dcdn.example.com/triggers/uCDN".  This URL was given to
       the uCDN when the CI/T interface was established.</t>

	<t>The dCDN authenticates the request, validates the CI/T Command,
       and, if it accepts the request, creates a new Trigger Status
       Resource.</t>

	<t>The dCDN responds to the uCDN with an HTTP 201 response status
       and the location of the Trigger Status Resource.</t>

	<t>The uCDN MAY query, possibly repeatedly, the Trigger Status
       Resource in the dCDN.</t>

	<t>The dCDN responds to each query with the Trigger Status Resource, describing
       the progress or results of the CI/T Trigger Command.</t>

	</list>
	</t>

	<t>
   The remainder of this document describes the messages, Trigger Status
   Resources, and collections of Trigger Status Resources in more
   detail.</t>

	<section title="Timing of Triggered Activity" anchor="sect-2.1"><t>
   Timing of the execution of CI/T Commands is under the dCDN's control,
   including its start time and pacing of the activity in the network. 
   Instructions regarding this timing may be included in the trigger using 
   one of the Trigger Extension Objects defined in 
   <xref target="trigger-extension-objects"/>.</t>

	<t>
   CI/T "invalidate" and "purge" commands MUST be applied to all data
   acquired before the command was accepted by the dCDN.  The dCDN
   SHOULD NOT apply CI/T "invalidate" and "purge" commands to data
   acquired after the CI/T Command was accepted, but this may not always
   be achievable, so the uCDN cannot count on that.</t>

	<t>
   If the uCDN wishes to invalidate or purge content and then
   immediately pre-position replacement content at the same URLs, it
   SHOULD ensure that the dCDN has completed the invalidate/purge before
   initiating the pre-positioning.  Otherwise, there is a risk that the
   dCDN pre-positions the new content, then immediately invalidates or
   purges it (as a result of the two uCDN requests running in parallel).</t>

	<t>
   Because the CI/T Command timing is under the dCDN's control, the dCDN
   implementation can choose whether to apply CI/T "invalidate" and
   "purge" commands to content acquisition that has already started when
   the command is received.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Scope of Triggered Activity" anchor="sect-2.2"><t>
   Each CI/T Command can operate on multiple metadata and content elements, 
   usually referred to by their URLs. These elements are targeted by specifying
   both their subject (i.e., "metadata" or "content") as well as specification 
   method (e.g., URL Regexes) and value.
   </t>

	<t>
   Multiple representations of an HTTP resource may share the same URL.
   CI/T Trigger Commands that invalidate or purge metadata or content
   apply to all resource representations with matching URLs.</t>

	<section title="Multiple Interconnected CDNs" anchor="sect-2.2.1"><t>
   In a network of interconnected CDNs, a single uCDN will originate a
   given item of metadata and associated content.  It would possibly distribute
   that metadata and content to more than one dCDN, which in turn
   distribute that metadata and content to additional CDNs located further
   downstream.</t>

	<t>
   An intermediate CDN is a dCDN that passes on CDNI Metadata and
   content to dCDNs located further downstream.</t>

	<t>
   A "diamond" configuration is one where a dCDN can acquire metadata
   and content originated in one uCDN from that uCDN itself and an
   intermediate CDN, or via more than one intermediate CDN.</t>

	<t>
   CI/T Commands originating in the single source uCDN affect metadata
   and content in all dCDNs; however, in a diamond configuration, it may
   not be possible for the dCDN to determine from which uCDN it acquired
   content.  In this case, a dCDN MUST allow each uCDN from which
   it may have acquired the content to act upon that content using CI/T
   Commands.</t>

	<t>
   In all other cases, a dCDN MUST reject CI/T Commands from a uCDN that
   attempts to act on another uCDN's content by using, for example,
   responding with an HTTP 403 ("Forbidden").</t>

	<t>
   Security considerations are discussed further in <xref target="sect-8"/>.</t>

	<t>
   The diamond configuration may lead to inefficient interactions, but
   the interactions are otherwise harmless.  For example:</t>

	<t><list style="symbols"><t>When the uCDN issues an "invalidate" CI/T Command, a dCDN will
      receive that command from multiple directly connected uCDNs.  The
      dCDN may schedule multiple such commands separately, and the last
      scheduled command may affect content already revalidated following
      execution of the "invalidate" command that was scheduled first.</t>

	<t>If one of a dCDN's directly connected uCDNs loses its rights to
      distribute content, it may issue a CI/T "purge" command.  That
      purge may affect content the dCDN could retain because it's
      distributed by another directly connected uCDN.  But, that content
      can be reacquired by the dCDN from the remaining uCDN.</t>

	<t>When the uCDN originating an item of content issues a CI/T purge
      followed by a pre-position, two directly connected uCDNs will pass
      those commands to a dCDN.  That dCDN implementation need not merge
      those operations or notice the repetition, in which case the purge
      issued by one uCDN will complete before the other.  The first uCDN
      to finish its purge may then forward the "preposition" trigger,
      and content pre-positioned as a result might be affected by the
      still-running purge issued by the other uCDN.  However, the dCDN
      will reacquire that content as needed, or when it's asked to
      pre-position the content by the second uCDN.  A dCDN
      implementation could avoid this interaction by knowing which uCDN
      it acquired the content from, or it could minimize the
      consequences by recording the time at which the
      "invalidate"/"purge" command was received and not applying it to
      content acquired after that time.</t>

	</list>

	<section title="Trigger Results" anchor="sect-2.3"><t>
   Possible states for a Trigger Status Resource are defined in
   <xref target="sect-5.2.3"/>.</t>

	<t>
   The CI/T Trigger Command MUST NOT be reported as "complete" until all
   operations have been completed successfully.  The reasons for failure,
   and URLs or patterns affected, SHOULD be enumerated in the Trigger
   Status Resource.  For more details, see <xref target="sect-4.7"/>.</t>

	<t>
   If a dCDN is also acting as a uCDN in a cascade, it MUST forward CI/T
   Commands to any dCDNs that may be affected.  The CI/T Trigger Command
   MUST NOT be reported as "complete" in a CDN until it is "complete" in
   all of its dCDNs.  If a CI/T Trigger Command is reported as
   "processed" in any dCDN, intermediate CDNs MUST NOT report
   "complete"; instead, they MUST also report "processed".  A CI/T
   Command MAY be reported as "failed" as soon as it fails in a CDN or
   in any of its dCDNs.  A cancelled CI/T Trigger Command MUST be
   reported as "cancelling" until it has been reported as "cancelled",
   "complete", or "failed" by all dCDNs in a cascade.</t>

	<section title="Collections of Trigger Status Resources" anchor="sect-3"><t>
   As described in <xref target="sect-2"/>, Trigger Status Resources exist in the dCDN
   to report the status of activity triggered by each uCDN.</t>

	<t>
   A collection of Trigger Status Resources is a resource that contains
   a reference to each Trigger Status Resource in that collection.
   Note that the collection may possibly refer to Trigger Status Resources of triggers from several CI/T objects versions,
   i.e., a subsequent call for the retrieval of the relevant trigger status may provide 
   objects of various MIME media types: ci-trigger-status as defined in <xref target="RFC8007"/>, ci-trigger-status.v2 
   defined in this document, or objects of future CI/T objects versions, based on the CI/T command version used for the creation of the trigger. </t>

	<t>
   The dCDN MUST make a collection of a uCDN's Trigger Status Resources
   available to that uCDN.  This collection includes all of the Trigger
   Status Resources created for CI/T Commands from the uCDN that have
   been accepted by the dCDN and have not yet been deleted by the uCDN
   or expired and removed by the dCDN (as described in <xref target="sect-4.4"/>).
   Trigger Status Resources belonging to a uCDN MUST NOT be visible to
   any other CDN.  The dCDN could, for example, achieve this by offering
   different collection URLs to each uCDN and by filtering the response
   based on the uCDN with which the HTTP client is associated.</t>

	<t>
   To trigger an activity in a dCDN or to cancel a triggered activity, the
   uCDN POSTs a CI/T Command to the dCDN's collection of the uCDN's
   Trigger Status Resources.</t>

	<t>
   In order to allow the uCDN to check the status of multiple jobs in a
   single request, the dCDN MAY also maintain collections representing
   filtered views of the collection of all Trigger Status Resources.
   These filtered collections are "optional-to-implement", but if they
   are implemented, the dCDN MUST include links to them in the
   collection of all Trigger Status Resources.  The filtered
   collections are:</t>

	<t><list style="symbols"><t>Pending - Trigger Status Resources for CI/T Trigger Commands that
      have been accepted but not yet acted upon.</t>

	<t>Active - Trigger Status Resources for CI/T Trigger Commands that
      are currently being processed in the dCDN.</t>

	<t>Complete - Trigger Status Resources representing activity that
      completed successfully, and "processed" CI/T Trigger Commands for
      which no further status updates will be made by the dCDN.</t>

	<t>Failed - Trigger Status Resources representing CI/T Commands that
      failed or were cancelled by the uCDN.</t>

	</list>
	</t>

	</section>

	<section title="CDNI Trigger Interface" anchor="sect-4"><t>
   This section describes an interface to enable a uCDN to trigger
   activity in a dCDN.</t>

	<t>
   The CI/T interface builds on top of HTTP, so dCDNs may make use of
   any HTTP feature when implementing the CI/T interface.  For example,
   a dCDN SHOULD make use of HTTP's caching mechanisms to indicate that
   a requested response/representation has not been modified, reducing
   the uCDN's processing needed to determine whether the status of
   triggered activity has changed.</t>

	<t>
   All dCDNs implementing CI/T MUST support the HTTP GET, HEAD, POST,
   and DELETE methods as defined in <xref target="RFC9110"/>.</t>

	<t>
   The only representation specified in this document is JSON <xref target="RFC8259"/>.
   It MUST be supported by the uCDN and by the dCDN.</t>

	<t>
   The URL of the dCDN's collection of all Trigger Status Resources
   needs to be either discovered by or configured in the uCDN.  The
   mechanism for discovery of that URL is outside the scope of this
   document.</t>

	<t>
   CI/T Commands are POSTed to the dCDN's collection of all Trigger
   Status Resources.  If a CI/T Trigger Command is accepted by the dCDN,
   the dCDN creates a new Trigger Status Resource and returns its URI to
   the uCDN in an HTTP 201 response.  The triggered activity can then be
   monitored by the uCDN using that resource and the collections
   described in <xref target="sect-3"/>.</t>

	<t>
   The URI of each Trigger Status Resource is returned to the uCDN when
   it is created, and URIs of all Trigger Status Resources are listed in
   the dCDN's collection of all Trigger Status Resources.  This means
   all Trigger Status Resources can be discovered by the uCDN, so dCDNs
   are free to assign whatever structure they desire to the URIs for
   CI/T resources.  Therefore, uCDNs MUST NOT make any assumptions
   regarding the structure of CI/T URIs or the mapping between CI/T
   objects and their associated URIs.  URIs present in the examples in
   this document are purely illustrative and are not intended to impose
   a definitive structure on CI/T interface implementations.</t>

	<section title="Creating Triggers" anchor="sect-4.1"><t>
   To issue a CI/T Command, the uCDN makes an HTTP POST to the dCDN's
   collection of all of the uCDN's Trigger Status Resources.  The
   request body of that POST is a CI/T Command, as described in
   <xref target="sect-5.1.1"/>.</t>

	<t>
   The dCDN validates the CI/T Command.  If the command is malformed or
   the uCDN does not have sufficient access rights, the dCDN MUST either
   respond with an appropriate 4xx HTTP error code and not create a
   Trigger Status Resource or create a "failed" Trigger Status Resource
   containing an appropriate Error.v2 Description.</t>

	<t>
   When a CI/T Trigger Command is accepted, the dCDN MUST create a new
   Trigger Status Resource that will convey a specification of the CI/T
   Command and its current status.  The HTTP response to the uCDN MUST
   have status code 201 and MUST convey the URI of the Trigger Status
   Resource in the Location header field <xref target="RFC9110"/>.  The HTTP response
   SHOULD include the content of the newly created Trigger Status
   Resource.  This is particularly important in cases where the CI/T
   Trigger Command has completed immediately.</t>

	<t>
   Once a Trigger Status Resource has been created, the dCDN MUST NOT
   reuse its URI, even after that Trigger Status Resource has been
   removed.</t>

	<t>
   The dCDN SHOULD track and report on the progress of CI/T Trigger
   Commands using a Trigger Status Resource (<xref target="sect-5.1.2"/>).  If the
   dCDN is not able to do that, it MUST indicate that it has accepted
   the request but will not be providing further status updates.  To do
   this, it sets the status of the Trigger Status Resource to
   "processed".  In this case, CI/T processing should continue as for a
   "complete" request, so the Trigger Status Resource MUST be added to
   the dCDN's collection of complete Trigger Status Resources.  The dCDN
   SHOULD also provide an estimated completion time for the request by
   using the "etime" property of the Trigger Status Resource.  This will
   allow the uCDN to schedule pre-positioning after an earlier delete of
   the same URLs is expected to have finished.</t>

	<t>
   If the dCDN is able to track the execution of CI/T Commands and a
   CI/T Command is queued by the dCDN for later action, the "status"
   property of the Trigger Status Resource MUST be "pending".  Once
   processing has started, the status MUST be "active".  Finally, once
   the CI/T Command is complete, the status MUST be set to "complete" or
   "failed".</t>

	<t>
   A CI/T Trigger Command may result in no activity in the dCDN if, for
   example, it is an "invalidate" or "purge" request for data the dCDN
   has not yet acquired, or a "preposition" request for data that it has
   already acquired and that is still valid.  In this case, the status
   of the Trigger Status Resource MUST be "processed" or "complete", and
   the Trigger Status Resource MUST be added to the dCDN's collection of
   complete Trigger Status Resources.</t>

	<t>
   Once created, Trigger Status Resources can be cancelled or deleted by
   the uCDN, but not modified.  The dCDN MUST reject PUT and POST
   requests from the uCDN to Trigger Status Resources by responding with
   an appropriate HTTP status code -- for example, 405 ("Method Not Allowed").</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Checking Status" anchor="sect-4.2"><t>
   The uCDN has two ways to check the progress of CI/T Commands it has
   issued to the dCDN, as described in Sections <xref target="sect-4.2.1"/> and 
   <xref target="sect-4.2.2"/>.</t>

	<t>
   To allow the uCDN to check for changes in the status of a Trigger
   Status Resource or collection of Trigger Status Resources without
   refetching the whole resource or collection, the dCDN SHOULD include
   entity-tags (ETags) for the uCDN to use as cache validators, as
   defined in <xref target="RFC9110"/>.</t>

	<t>
   The dCDN SHOULD use the cache control headers for responses to GETs
   for Trigger Status Resources and Collections to indicate the
   frequency at which it recommends that the uCDN should poll for
   change.</t>

	<section title="Polling Trigger Status Resource Collections" anchor="sect-4.2.1"><t>
   The uCDN can fetch the collection of its Trigger Status Resources or
   filtered views of that collection.</t>

	<t>
   This makes it possible to poll the status of all CI/T Trigger
   Commands in a single request.  If the dCDN moves a Trigger Status
   Resource from the active to the completed collection, the uCDN can
   fetch the result of that activity.</t>

	<t>
   When polling in this way, the uCDN SHOULD use HTTP ETags to monitor
   for change, rather than repeatedly fetching the whole collection.  An
   example of this is given in <xref target="sect-6.2.4"/>.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Polling Trigger Status Resources" anchor="sect-4.2.2"><t>
   The uCDN has a URI provided by the dCDN for each Trigger Status
   Resource it has created.  It may fetch that Trigger Status Resource
   at any time.</t>

	<t>
   This can be used to retrieve progress information and to fetch the
   result of the CI/T Command.</t>

	<t>
   When polling in this way, the uCDN SHOULD use HTTP ETags to monitor
   for change, rather than repeatedly fetching the Trigger Status
   Resource.</t>

	</section>

	</section>

	<section title="Cancelling Triggers" anchor="sect-4.3"><t>
   The uCDN can request cancellation of a CI/T Trigger Command by
   POSTing a CI/T Cancel Command (see <xref target="sect-5.1.1-cancel"/>) to the
   specific trigger's Trigger Status Resource URL.</t>

	<t>
   The dCDN is required to accept and respond to the CI/T Cancel
   Command, but the actual cancellation of a CI/T Trigger Command is
   optional-to-implement.</t>

	<t>
   The dCDN MUST respond to the CI/T Cancel Command appropriately -- for
   example, with HTTP status code 200 ("OK") if the cancellation has
   been processed and the CI/T Command is inactive, 202 ("Accepted") if
   the command has been accepted but the CI/T Command remains active, 404 ("Not Found") 
   when the Trigger Status Resource does not exist, or
   501 ("Not Implemented") if cancellation is not supported by the dCDN.</t>

	<t>
   If cancellation of a "pending" Trigger Status Resource is accepted by
   the dCDN, the dCDN SHOULD NOT start the processing of that activity.
   Issuing a CI/T Cancel Command for a "pending" Trigger Status Resource
   does not, however, guarantee that the corresponding activity will not
   be started, because the uCDN cannot control the timing of that
   activity.  Processing could, for example, start after the POST is
   sent by the uCDN but before that request is processed by the dCDN.</t>

	<t>
   If cancellation of an "active" or "processed" Trigger Status Resource
   is accepted by the dCDN, the dCDN SHOULD stop processing the CI/T
   Command.  However, as with cancellation of a "pending" CI/T Command,
   the dCDN does not guarantee this.</t>

	<t>
   If the CI/T Command cannot be stopped immediately, the status in the
   corresponding Trigger Status Resource MUST be set to "cancelling",
   and the Trigger Status Resource MUST remain in the collection of
   Trigger Status Resources for active CI/T Commands.  If processing is
   stopped before normal completion, the status value in the Trigger
   Status Resource MUST be set to "cancelled", and the Trigger Status
   Resource MUST be included in the collection of failed CI/T Trigger
   Commands.</t>

	<t>
   Cancellation of a "complete" or "failed" Trigger Status Resource
   requires no processing in the dCDN.  Its status MUST NOT be changed
   to "cancelled".</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Deleting Triggers" anchor="sect-4.4"><t>
   The uCDN can delete Trigger Status Resources at any time using the
   HTTP DELETE method. As defined in the CDNI Control Interface / Triggers 1st edition <xref target="RFC8007"/>,
   the effect is similar to cancellation, but no
   Trigger Status Resource remains afterwards. Note that in cases where the 
   trigger's status prior to the deletion is not a terminal status (i.e., "completed", "failed"
   or "cancelled"), the uCDN would not have the ability to further monitor the 
   cancellation process and the final status of the trigger. 
   For this reason, it is recommended that the cancellation command (see
   <xref target="sect-5.1.1-cancel"/>) is used prior to trigger deletion, and deletion is only used
   on triggers with a terminal status.</t>

	<t>
   Once deleted, the references to a Trigger Status Resource MUST be
   removed from all Trigger Status Resource collections.  Subsequent
   requests to GET the deleted Trigger Status Resource SHOULD be
   rejected by the dCDN with an HTTP error.</t>

	<t>
   If a "pending" Trigger Status Resource is deleted, the dCDN
   SHOULD NOT start the processing of that activity.  Deleting a
   "pending" Trigger Status Resource does not, however, guarantee that
   it has not started, because the uCDN cannot control the timing of
   that activity.  Processing may, for example, start after the DELETE
   is sent by the uCDN but before that request is processed by the dCDN.</t>

	<t>
   If an "active" or "processed" Trigger Status Resource is deleted, the
   dCDN SHOULD stop processing the CI/T Command.  However, as with
   deletion of a "pending" Trigger Status Resource, the dCDN does not
   guarantee this.</t>

	<t>
   Deletion of a "complete" or "failed" Trigger Status Resource requires
   no processing in the dCDN other than deletion of the Trigger Status
   Resource.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Expiry of Trigger Status Resources" anchor="sect-4.5"><t>
   The dCDN can choose to automatically delete Trigger Status Resources
   some time after they become "complete", "processed", "failed", or
   "cancelled".  In this case, the dCDN will remove the Trigger Status
   Resource and respond to subsequent requests for it with an HTTP
   error.</t>

	<t>
   If the dCDN does remove Trigger Status Resources automatically, it
   MUST report the length of time after which it will do so, using a
   property of the collection of all Trigger Status Resources.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that Trigger Status Resources are not automatically
   deleted by the dCDN for at least 24 hours after they become
   "complete", "processed", "failed", or "cancelled".</t>

	<t>
   To ensure that it is able to get the status of its Trigger Status
   Resources for completed and failed CI/T Commands, it is RECOMMENDED
   that the uCDN polling interval is less than the time after which
   records for completed activity will be deleted.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Loop Detection and Prevention" anchor="sect-4.6"><t>
   Given three CDNs, A, B, and C, if CDNs B and C delegate delivery of
   CDN A's content to each other, CDN A's CI/T Commands could be passed
   between CDNs B and C in a loop.  More complex networks of CDNs could
   contain similar loops involving more hops.</t>

	<t>
   In order to prevent and detect such CI/T loops, each CDN uses a CDN
   Provider ID (PID) to uniquely identify itself.  In every CI/T Command
   it originates or cascades, each CDN MUST append an array element
   containing its CDN PID to a JSON array under an entry named
   "cdn-path".  When receiving CI/T Commands, a dCDN MUST check the
   cdn-path and reject any CI/T Command that already contains its own
   CDN PID in the cdn-path.  Transit CDNs MUST check the cdn-path and
   not cascade the CI/T Command to dCDNs that are already listed in the
   cdn-path.</t>

	<t>
   The CDN PID consists of the two characters "AS" followed by the CDN
   provider's Autonomous System number <xref target="RFC1930"/>, then a colon (":") and
   an additional qualifier that is used to guarantee uniqueness in case
   a particular AS has multiple independent CDNs deployed -- for
   example, "AS64496:0".</t>

	<t>
   If the CDN provider has multiple ASes, the same AS number SHOULD be
   used in all messages from that CDN provider, unless there are
   multiple distinct CDNs.</t>

	<t>
   If the CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface (RI) described in
   <xref target="RFC7975"/> is implemented by the dCDN, the CI/T interface and the RI
   SHOULD use the same CDN PID.</t>

	</section>
        
	<section title="Error Handling" anchor="sect-4.7"><t>
   A dCDN can signal rejection of a CI/T Command using HTTP status codes
   -- for example, 400 ("Bad Request") if the request is malformed, or
   403 ("Forbidden") or 404 ("Not Found") if the uCDN does not have
   permission to issue CI/T Commands or it is trying to act on another
   CDN's data.</t>

	<t>
   If any part of the CI/T Trigger Command fails, the trigger SHOULD be
   reported as "failed" once its activity is complete or if no further
   errors will be reported.  The "errors" property in the Trigger Status
   Resource will be used to enumerate which actions failed and the
   reasons for failure, and can be present while the Trigger Status
   Resource is still "pending" or "active", if the CI/T Trigger Command
   is still running for some URLs or patterns in the Trigger
   Specification.</t>

	<t>
   Once a request has been accepted, processing errors are reported in
   the Trigger Status Resource using a list of Error.v2 Descriptions.  Each
   Error.v2 Description is used to report errors against one or more of the
   URLs or patterns in the Trigger Specification.</t>

	<t>
   If a Surrogate affected by a CI/T Trigger Command is offline in the
   dCDN or the dCDN is unable to pass a CI/T Command on to any of its
   cascaded dCDNs:</t>

	<t><list style="symbols"><t>If the CI/T Command is abandoned by the dCDN, the dCDN SHOULD
      report an error.</t>

	<t>A CI/T "invalidate" command may be reported as "complete" when
      Surrogates that may have the data are offline.  In this case,
      Surrogates MUST NOT use the affected data without first
      revalidating it when they are back online.</t>

	<t>CI/T "preposition" and "purge" commands can be reported as
      "processed" if affected caches are offline and the activity will
      complete when they return to service.</t>

	<t>Otherwise, the dCDN SHOULD keep the Trigger Status Resource in
      state "pending" or "active" until either the CI/T Command is acted
      upon or the uCDN chooses to cancel it.</t>

        <section anchor="error-propagation" title="Error propagation">
          <t>
             This subsection explains the mechanism for enabling the uCDN to trace an error back to the dCDN in which it occurred.
             CDNI triggers may be propagated over a chain of downstream CDNs. For example, an 
             upstream CDN A (uCDN-A) that is delegating to a downstream CDN B (dCDN-B) and dCDN-B is delegating 
             to a downstream CDN C (dCDN-C). Triggers sent from uCDN-A to dCDN-B may be redistributed 
             from dCDN-B to dCDN-C, and errors can occur anywhere along the path. Therefore, it might be essential for 
             uCDN-A that sets the trigger, be able to trace back an error to the downstream CDN where it occurred. 
             This document adds a mechanism to propagate the 
			 PID of the dCDN where the fault occurred, back to the 
             uCDN by adding the PID
             to the error.v2 description. When dCDN-B propagates a trigger further to the downstream dCDN-C, 
             it MUST also propagate back the errors received in the trigger status resource from dCDN-C by adding
             them to the errors array in its own status resource to be sent back to the originating uCDN-A.
             While propagating back the errors dCDN-B MAY also 
             specify the dCDN-C PID, indicating to which CDN the error specifically relates.
             The trigger originating upstream CDN then receives an array built of the errors that occurred 
             in all the CDNs along the execution path, where each error MAY be carrying its own CDN identifier.

          The steps in <xref target="error-propagation-seq"/> are as follows:
          </t>
					<t>
						<list style="numbers">
							<t>
								The uCDN-A triggers action in the dCDN-B by POSTing a CI/T Command to a collection of
								Trigger Status Resources "https://dcdn-b.example.com/triggers/uCDN-A". This URL was given to
								the uCDN-A when the CI/T interface was established.
							</t>
							<t>
								The dCDN-B authenticates the request, validates the CI/T Command, and, if it accepts the request, creates a new Trigger Status Resource.
							</t>
							<t>
								The dCDN-B responds to the uCDN-A with an HTTP 201 response status
								and the location of the Trigger Status Resource.
							</t>
							<t>
								The dCDN-B triggers the action in the dCDN-C by POSTing a CI/T Command to
								a collection of Trigger Status Resources
								"https://dcdn-c.example.com/triggers/dCDN-B".  This URL was given to
								the dCDN-B when the CI/T interface was established.
							</t>
							<t>
								The dCDN-C authenticates the request, validates the CI/T Command,
								and, if it accepts the request, creates a new Trigger Status Resource.
							</t>
							<t>
								The dCDN-C responds to the dCDN-B with an HTTP 201 response status and
								the location of the Trigger Status Resource.
							</t>
							<t>
								The dCDN-C acts upon the CI/T Command. However, the command fails at dCDN-C as,
								for example, the Trigger Specification contains an "action type" that is not supported by dCDN-C.
								dCDN-C's action is depicted by 7.2 in the diagram, while 7.1 shows dCDN-B acting on its own
								command.
							</t>
							<t>
								The dCDN-B queries, possibly repeatedly, the Trigger Status Resource in dCDN-C.
							</t>
							<t>
								The dCDN-C responds with the Trigger Status Resource, describing the progress or results
								of the CI/T Trigger Command. In the described flow, the returned Status is "failed",
								with an Error.v2 Description Object holding an "eunsupported" Error Code reflecting the status response.
							</t>
							<t>
								The uCDN-A queries, possibly repeatedly, the Trigger Status Resource in dCDN-B.
							</t>
							<t>
								The dCDN-B responds with the Trigger Status Resource, describing the progress or results of
								the CI/T Trigger Command. In the flow described above, the returned Status is "failed",
								and the "eunsupported" error received in the trigger status resource from dCDN-C is propagated along with dCDN-C PID
                by adding it to the errors array in dCDN-B's own status resource to be sent back to the originating uCDN-A.

          <t>
            A "trigger.v2" object, as defined in <xref target="sect-5.2.1"/> includes an
            optional array of trigger extension objects. A trigger extension contains properties
            that are used as directives for the dCDN when executing the trigger command, e.g., 
            location policies, time policies, and so on. Each such CDNI Trigger extension is a specialization
            of a CDNI GenericTriggerExtension object. The GenericTriggerExtension object abstracts the basic
            information required for trigger distribution from the specifics of any given property
            (i.e., property semantics, enforcement options, etc.). All trigger extensions are optional,
            and it is thus the responsibility of the extension specification to define a consistent default
            behavior for extensions supported by a dCDN when not specified by the uCDN.
          </t>

          <section anchor="enforcement-options" title="Enforcement Options">
           <t>
             The trigger enforcement options concept is in accordance with the metadata enforcement options
             as defined in Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC8006"/>.
           </t>
           <t>
             The GenericTriggerExtension object defines the properties contained within it
             as well as whether or not the properties are "mandatory-to-enforce".
             If the dCDN does not understand or support a mandatory-to-enforce
             property, the dCDN MUST NOT execute the trigger command. If the extension is
             not mandatory-to-enforce, then that GenericTriggerExtension object can be
             safely ignored and the trigger command can be processed in accordance
             with the rest of the CDNI Trigger spec.
           </t>
           <t>
             Although a CDN MUST NOT execute a trigger command if a
             mandatory-to-enforce extension cannot be enforced, it could still be
             safe to redistribute that trigger (the "safe-to-redistribute"
             property) to another CDN without modification.  For example, in the
             cascaded CDN case, a transit CDN (tCDN) could convey
             mandatory-to-enforce trigger extension to a dCDN.  For a trigger extension
             that does not require customization or translation (i.e., trigger extension
             that is safe-to-redistribute), the data representation received off the wire
             MAY be stored and redistributed without being understood or supported
             by the tCDN.  However, for trigger extension that requires translation,
             transparent redistribution of the uCDN trigger values might not be
             appropriate.  Certain triggers extensions can be safely, though perhaps not
             optimally, redistributed unmodified.  For example, pre-position command might
             be executed in suboptimal times for some geographies if transparently
             redistributed, but it might still work.
           </t>
           <t>
             Redistribution safety MUST be specified for each GenericTriggerExtension
             listed. If a CDN does not understand or support a given
             GenericTriggerExtension object that is not safe-to-redistribute, the CDN
             MUST set the "incomprehensible" flag to true for that GenericTriggerExtension
             object before redistributing it.  The "incomprehensible"
             flag signals to a dCDN that trigger metadata was not properly transformed
             by the tCDN.  A CDN MUST NOT attempt to execute a trigger with an extension that has been
             marked as "incomprehensible" by a uCDN.
           </t>
           <t>
             tCDNs MUST NOT change the value of mandatory-to-enforce or
             safe-to-redistribute when propagating a trigger to a dCDN.  Although a
             tCDN can set the value of "incomprehensible" to true, a tCDN MUST NOT
             change the value of "incomprehensible" from true to false.

   Along with the Trigger Status, the Trigger Status Resource object includes a Status Reason property,
   allowing the dCDN to provide additional information for the trigger status.
   For example, the dCDN may indicate that the trigger status is "pending" due to one of the execution prerequisites not
   being fulfilled. Such a prerequisite may possibly be specified via one of the extensions.</t>

	<section title="ObjectList" anchor="object-list"><t>
		ObjectList is a metadata object describing lists of objects that can be used in the context of CI/T v2 trigger spec, trigger status resources and other contexts as required. The ObjectList object can either embed the lists of objects or point to external URL(s) that hold such lists. ObjectList allows specification of an object list type, providing instructions on the interpretation of the object list format.</t>

	<t>
		ObjectLists MAY be recursive, i.e. including references to secondary manifests, including references to HLS, MPEG-DASH or MSS manifests as well as additional JSON-encoded ObjectLists , etc. The party consuming the object list MUST parse all recursions based on the object list type property. When doing so, the consuming party should also detect potential loops when descendant ObjectList points back to parent ObjectList.
	</t>
	<t>
		In case of uCDN accessing ObjectList objects referencing external URLs published by dCDN, both parties should comply with the CI/T interface security requirements (see <xref target="sect-8.1"/> for details). 
		When dCDN accesses external URLs referenced by ObjectLists supplied by uCDN, for example as part of Trigger Spec, the dCDN MUST match these URLs with source metadata objects, published by uCDN, such as SourceMetadata objects specified in Section 4.2.1 of <xref target="RFC8006"/>, and use these metadata objects for content acquisition if a match was found.
	</t>
	<t>
ObjectLists MAY combine regular objects and secondary ObjectLists in the same object.
		Please note that when embedding non-JSON object lists directly in ObjectList, absolute URLs MUST be provided at all times and the text SHOULD be encoded in accordance with the JSON grammar specification <xref target="ECMA404"/>, including explicit newline encoding. When the uCDN accesses ObjectList metadata resources published by the uCDN, the same interface authentication and authorization requirements would apply, as when accessing the interface itself.
	</t>

	<t>ObjectList is encoded as an array of per-object records in JSON format as follows:</t>

           If a location policy object is not listed within the trigger command, the default behavior is to
           execute the trigger in all available caches and locations of the dCDN.
        </t>
        <t>
           The trigger command is allowed, or denied, for a specific cache location according to the
           action of the first location whose footprint matches against that cache's location.
           If two or more footprints overlap, the first footprint that matches against the cache's location
           determines the action a CDN MUST take. If the "locations" property is an empty list or if none of
           the listed footprints match the location of a specific cache location, then the result is equivalent
           to a "deny" action.

      <section anchor="time-policy" title="TimePolicy Extension">
        <t>A uCDN may wish to perform content management operations on the dCDN on a specific schedule.
           The TimePolicy extensions allows the uCDN to instruct the dCDN to execute the trigger command
           in a desired time window. For example, a content provider that wishes to pre-populate a new
           episode at off-peak time so that it would be ready on caches at prime time when the episode
           is released for viewing. A scheduled operation enables the uCDN to direct the dCDN in what
           time frame to execute the trigger.
        </t>
        <t>
           A uCDN may wish to schedule a trigger such that the dCDN will execute it in local time,
           as it is measured in each region. For example, a uCDN may wish the dCDN to pull the content
           at off-peak hours, between 2AM-4AM, however, as a CDN is distributed across multiple time
           zones, the UTC definition of 2AM depends on the actual location.
        </t>
        <t>We define two alternatives for localized scheduling:<list style="symbols">
           <t>Regional schedule: When used in conjunction with the Location Policy defined
              in <xref target="location-policy"/>, the uCDN can trigger separate commands for
              different geographical regions, for each region using a different schedule. This allows
              the uCDN to control the execution time per region.
           </t>
           <t>Local Time schedule: We introduce a "local time" version for Internet timestamps
              that follows the notation for local time as defined in Section 4.2.2 of <xref target="ISO8601"/>.
              When local time is used, that dCDN SHOULD execute the triggers at different absolute times,
              according the local time of each execution location.

   The following subsections provide examples of different CI/T objects
   encoded as JSON.</t>

	<t>
   Discovery of the CI/T interface is out of scope for this document.
   In an implementation, all CI/T URLs are under the control of the
   dCDN.  The uCDN MUST NOT attempt to ascribe any meaning to individual
   elements of the path.</t>

	<t>
   In examples in this section, the URL "https://dcdn.example.com/triggers" is used as the location of the collection of all Trigger
   Status Resources, and the CDN PID of the uCDN is "AS64496:1".</t>

	<section title="Creating Triggers" anchor="sect-6.1"><t>
   Examples of the uCDN triggering activity in the dCDN:</t>

	<section title="Preposition" anchor="sect-6.1.1"><t>
   Below is an example of a CI/T "preposition" command -- a POST to the
   collection of all Trigger Status Resources.</t>

	<t>
    Note that pattern based specs like "UriPatternMatch" and "UrisRegexMatch",  are not allowed
   in a pre-position Trigger Specification, where the dCDN has to have a clear list of objects to obtain.</t>

          <t>
            In the following example a CI/T "preposition" command is using two extensions to control the
            way the trigger is executed. In this example the receiving dCDN, identified as "AS64500:0",
            does not support the first extension in the extensions array. dCDN "AS64500:0" further
            distributes this trigger to another downstream CDN that is identified as "AS64501:0", which
            does not support the second extension in the extensions array. The error is propagated from
            "AS64501:0" to "AS64500:0" and the errors.v2 array reflects both errors.

	<t> In this second edition of the interface, trigger types are referred to as "trigger actions". The "Trigger Types" registry is used for actions definitions. Furthermore, this document, and specifically <xref target="sect-5.2.2"/>, reuses the definition of "trigger types" as defined in <xref target="RFC8007"/> as trigger actions,
    and provide their specifications, with no modification comparing to <xref target="RFC8007"/>.</t>

	<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sect-8"><t>
   The CI/T interface provides a mechanism to allow a uCDN to generate
   requests into the dCDN and to inspect its own CI/T requests and their
   current states.  The CI/T interface does not allow access to, or
   modification of, the uCDN or dCDN metadata relating to content
   delivery or to the content itself.  It can only control the presence
   of that metadata in the dCDN, and the processing work and network
   utilization involved in ensuring that presence.</t>

	<t>
   By examining "preposition" requests to a dCDN, and correctly
   interpreting content and metadata URLs, an attacker could learn the
   uCDN's or content owner's predictions for future content popularity.
   By examining "invalidate" or "purge" requests, an attacker could
   learn about changes in the content owner's catalog.</t>

	<t>
   By injecting CI/T Commands, an attacker or a misbehaving uCDN would
   generate work in the dCDN and uCDN as they process those requests.
   So would a man-in-the-middle attacker modifying valid CI/T Commands
   generated by the uCDN.  In both cases, that would decrease the dCDN's
   caching efficiency by causing it to unnecessarily acquire or
   reacquire content metadata and/or content.</t>

	<t>
   A dCDN implementation of CI/T MUST restrict the actions of a uCDN to
   the data corresponding to that uCDN.  Failure to do so would allow
   uCDNs to detrimentally affect each other's efficiency by generating
   unnecessary acquisition or reacquisition load.</t>

	<t>
   An origin that chooses to delegate its delivery to a CDN is trusting
   that CDN to deliver content on its behalf; the interconnection of
   CDNs is an extension of that trust to dCDNs.  That trust relationship
   is a commercial arrangement, outside the scope of the CDNI protocols.
   So, while a malicious CDN could deliberately generate load on a dCDN
   using the CI/T interface, the protocol does not otherwise attempt to
   address malicious behavior between interconnected CDNs.</t>

	<section title="Authentication, Authorization, Confidentiality, Integrity Protection" anchor="sect-8.1"><t>
   A CI/T implementation MUST support Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   transport for HTTP (HTTPS) as per <xref target="RFC9110"/>.</t>

	<t>
   TLS MUST be used by the server side (dCDN) and the client side (uCDN)
   of the CI/T interface, including authentication of the remote end,
   unless alternate methods are used for ensuring the security of the
   information in the CI/T interface requests and responses (such as
   setting up an IPsec tunnel between the two CDNs or using a physically
   secured internal network between two CDNs that are owned by the same
   corporate entity).</t>

	<t>
   The use of TLS for transport of the CI/T interface allows the dCDN
   and the uCDN to authenticate each other using TLS client
   authentication and TLS server authentication.</t>

	<t>
   Once the dCDN and the uCDN have mutually authenticated each other,
   TLS allows:</t>

	<t><list style="symbols"><t>The dCDN and the uCDN to authorize each other (to ensure that they
      are receiving CI/T Commands from, or reporting status to, an
      authorized CDN).</t>

	<t>CDNI commands and responses to be transmitted with
      confidentiality.</t>

	<t>Protection of the integrity of CDNI commands and responses.</t>

	</list>
	</t>

	<t>
   When TLS is used, the general TLS usage guidance in <xref target="RFC9325"/> MUST be
   followed.</t>

	<t>
   The mechanisms for access control are dCDN-specific and are not
   standardized as part of this CI/T specification.</t>

	<t>
   HTTP requests that attempt to access or operate on CI/T data
   belonging to another CDN MUST be rejected using, for example,
   HTTP 403 ("Forbidden") or 404 ("Not Found").  This is intended to
   prevent unauthorized users from generating unnecessary load in dCDNs
   or uCDNs due to revalidation, reacquisition, or unnecessary
   acquisition.</t>

	<t>
   When deploying a network of interconnected CDNs, the possible
   inefficiencies related to the diamond configuration discussed in
   <xref target="sect-2.2.1"/> should be considered.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Denial of Service" anchor="sect-8.2"><t>
   This document does not define a specific mechanism to protect against
   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on the CI/T interface.  However, CI/T
   endpoints can be protected against DoS attacks through the use of TLS
   transport and/or via mechanisms outside the scope of the CI/T
   interface, such as firewalling or the use of Virtual Private Networks
   (VPNs).</t>

	<t>
   Depending on the implementation, triggered activity may consume
   significant processing and bandwidth in the dCDN.  A malicious or
   faulty uCDN could use this to generate unnecessary load in the dCDN.
   The dCDN should consider mechanisms to avoid overload -- for example,
   by rate-limiting acceptance or processing of CI/T Commands, or by
   performing batch processing.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Privacy" anchor="sect-8.3"><t>
   The CI/T protocol does not carry any information about individual end
   users of a CDN; there are no privacy concerns for end users.</t>

	<t>
   The CI/T protocol does carry information that could be considered
   commercially sensitive by CDN operators and content owners.  The use
   of mutually authenticated TLS to establish a secure session for the
   transport of CI/T data, as discussed in <xref target="sect-8.1"/>, provides
   confidentiality while the CI/T data is in transit and prevents
   parties other than the authorized dCDN from gaining access to that
   data.  The dCDN MUST ensure that it only exposes CI/T data related to
   a uCDN to clients it has authenticated as belonging to that uCDN.</t>
